#### Networking Without Nausea

When you are looking for a job, everyone will tell you to leverage your network. A strong network can increase your access to professional resources and employment options. But how do you create a network that leads to opportunity? How can you ask for something without coming across as needy? How do can you forge connections that feel organic and genuine?

This session will clarify the process of growing your network. Through anecdotes we’ll explore how people connect, how relationships evolve, and how professional opportunities emerge. You’ll leave with five specific strategies for growing a network that is not only strong when you need it, but provides ongoing value and energy for everyone involved.

#### How to roll your own static site generator and why. (Spoiler alert: because it's fun!)

Have you ever been frustrated with Jekyll or Hexo? Do you want a little more control than you get on Medium? Do you like rolling your own thing?

In this talk I am going to show you how to build a static site generator for a simple blog. In the course of this we will talk about the differences between static and dynamic sites and the benefits of both. I hope to convince you that writing your own static site generator is by no means as daunting as it sounds and makes for a super fun and educational side project.
