[Catherine Meyers](https://github.com/ccmeyers), Software Engineer at Mavenlink, presents:

#### A Good Programmer is a Good Teacher (and Student)"

We've all experienced it: a coder our company just hired comes over to ask questions about the codebase. This coder might be a senior dev new to our codebase or a junior dev new to coding in general. How do we efficiently answer questions and teach in an effective manner.

Most of us haven't gone to school to learn how to teach. Yet, teaching is a part of most programmers' daily lives. With this talk, you'll get some tips and tricks on how to become a better teacher. And by learning how to teach, we'll also learn how to be a better student.

[Jeff Moore](https://github.com/jhmoore), TP Architect / King of Puns at Mavenlink, presents:

#### Integration Tests Vs. Unit Tests: Who Will Win?

In a world where code breaks all the time for no discernible reason, which way of catching regressions will reign supreme? Why even write tests at all? What does it mean?

In addition to discussing the 'how,' we will examine the 'where' and 'why' of testing your code. Philosophizing will occur.
