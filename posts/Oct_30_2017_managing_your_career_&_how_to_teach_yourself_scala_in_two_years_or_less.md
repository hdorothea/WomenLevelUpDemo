#### Managing your career and taking advantage of your prior (not unrelated!) experience"

What do careers in sales and engineering have in common? What does being a fighter pilot have to do with being in the infantry? This talk will explore how you might use - and not shy away from - other career experiences in your current endeavor. Insight and empathy can often come from seemingly tangential things.

#### How to Teach Yourself Scala in Two Years or Less"

Peter will discuss his learnings over the 2-ish years he spent taking a hackathon project from proof-of-concept to a first-class member of the Mavenlink stack. Changestream captures change events from the MySQL binlog and transforms them into JSON that can be consumed anywhere.
